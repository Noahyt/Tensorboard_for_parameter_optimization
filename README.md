# Tensorboard_for_parameter_optimization

I wanted to practice using tensor board and had just watched this cool demo from the TensorFlow conference (https://youtu.be/eBbEDRsCmv4?t=887).  

I wrote my own version of this test, to experiment with tensor board visualizations, and see how they could be used to help with hyperparameter optimization.  

I remember when I was first getting into machine learning, the number of “knobs” (hyper parameters) that I had to adjust was completely overwhelming.  I think being able to easily see the results of many tests simultaneously is a huge bonus for ML beginners and pros!
